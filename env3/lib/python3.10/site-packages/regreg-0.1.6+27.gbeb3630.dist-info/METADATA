RegReg
######

RegReg is a simple multi-algorithm Python framework for prototyping and solving
regularized regression problems such as the LASSO. The goal is to enable
practitioners to quickly and easily experiment with a variety of different
models and choices of regularization.  In that spirit, the emphasis is on the
flexibility of the framework instead of computational speed for any particular
problem, though the speed trade-off will generally not be too bad.
